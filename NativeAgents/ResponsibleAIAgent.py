# OpenAI's moderation endpoint. Refer: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation 
# The moderations endpoint is a tool you can use to check whether content complies with OpenAI's usage policies. Developers can thus identify content that our usage policies prohibits and take action, for instance by filtering it.
# The models classifies the following categories:
# CATEGORY	DESCRIPTION
# hate	Content that expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. Hateful content aimed at non-protected groups (e.g., chess players) is harrassment.
# hate/threatening	Hateful content that also includes violence or serious harm towards the targeted group based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste.
# harassment	Content that expresses, incites, or promotes harassing language towards any target.
# harassment/threatening	Harassment content that also includes violence or serious harm towards any target.
# self-harm	Content that promotes, encourages, or depicts acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders.
# self-harm/intent	Content where the speaker expresses that they are engaging or intend to engage in acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders.
# self-harm/instructions	Content that encourages performing acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders, or that gives instructions or advice on how to commit such acts.
# sexual	Content meant to arouse sexual excitement, such as the description of sexual activity, or that promotes sexual services (excluding sex education and wellness).
# sexual/minors	Sexual content that includes an individual who is under 18 years old.
# violence	Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury.
# violence/graphic	Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury in graphic detail.

### This API is free. Hence, we'll use it without a concern for cost
### This can however impact latency. Hence, this call can  be done indendent of the main call if latency is a concern.
### In current task, since it is not a production system, we will execute in sequential manner.
