## Scenario
An enterprise has several enterprise applications. On average an enterprise uses 150+ applications, each with 20+ APIs on average. There are 7000+ enterprise applications in the market. <br>
Example categories are:
HR: Workday
Sales: CRM (Salesforce)
Ticketing: JIRA

Merge.dev provides a **Unified API** enabling applications to integrate with hundreds of third-party integrations with single API and using **Common Models** for the categories of HRIS (HR, Payroll and Directory), Recruiting (ATS), Accounting, Ticketing, CRM, Marketing Automation.

## 1.1. Problem Statement
Design and Build a multi-tenant Conversational AI system over the **structured** data stored in these applications.

## 1.2. Constraints to be followed for the system design (Non Functional Requirements)
- We are a startup, training data initially is hard. In other words, assume you cannot do fine-tuning or regression with *real* training data.
- Optimized for Cost
- User interactiveness: Includes Quicker Response (Latency), asking Clarifying questions
- Accurate answers (i.e. Hallucination is not acceptable). 
- Gracefully, let the user know if you cannot answer the question accurately.
- Staleness: If data is stored in an intermediate system from the primary API source, design should account for ensuring there is no staleness in the data
- The usage scenarios might be such that it might not be straight forward to join data across models. Think of using Knowledge Graphs.
- Several user’s questions is not a simple API lookup. It may require access to multiple APIs.

## Outcome of this document
The primary motive of this assignment is this design document that provides a comprehensive view of the design that L5 engineers can independently implement. Pick a scenario to demonstrate the utility of the design.

<details open><summary></summary>

## Example Usage Scenarios
- Summarize my last conversation with Bill’s company
- How many vacations do I have remaining?
- What is the total HC cost for each of my managers?
- How much revenue does the top 10 customers bring in?
- What fraction of P0 bugs in my organization has been fixed within SLA?
- How many leads have we not met yet?
- Tell me the pending time off requests for my team members in Bangalore.
- For my team in bangalore, tell me the count of tickets assigned to each of them, and how many rounds of interview they each had.

## Sample Scenario
```*Summarize my last conversation with Bill's company*```

In order to execute this scenario, the agent must do the following:
1. Get 'Bill' from contacts in the CRM API for Contacts
2. *If there are multiple people with name Bill,* resolve the right `Bill`
   For Resolving the correct `Bill`, either Ask the User or Get most appropriate **Bill** from Knowledge Graph 
3. Get Bill's company (or *account_id*) from CRM API for Accounts
4. Get *last* conversation with that *account_id*
5. Summarize that conversation.

We will utilize this scenario to demonstrate the utility of various components of the design.

**Reason for picking this scenario** <br>
This scenario
- Demonstrates the case where multiple calls to the backend API needs to be made in order to answer this question
- Demonstrates the necessity of a possible interaction with user
- Demonstrates the utility of Knowledge Graph and making sure that Knowledge Graph is not very stale
- Demonstrates the ability to update the Execution plan according to the output from an intermediate step
- Ability to discuss latency optimization and Caching
- Ability to discuss a Recommendation System
- Ability to utilize Conversation History
- Demonstrates the ability to self heal
- It is also not overly complicated and keeps the discussion easy to demonstrate.

Two other scenarios I might use while discussing the design.<br>
```For my team in bangalore, tell me the count of tickets assigned to each of them, and how many rounds of interview they each had.``` (Reason: Compound Scenario) <br> 
```What is my time off balance ?.``` (Reason: Simple scenario) <br>

## Scope: Out of Scope & Assumptions being made

The following aspects of the design are either assumptions being made or are out-of-scope for this design document:
- We assume that Merge.Dev API has the latest information. The information lag between Merge.Dev and the actual applications is out of scope for this document. Merge.Dev has a frequent 'sync' mechanism, which we assume is sufficient.
- We also assume that the cost to making calls to Merge.Dev is extremely low. We only optimize the cost of using LLMs and not cost of using Merge.Dev
- We also assume that the latency of Merge.Dev API is very small. In other words, we will not optimize for the latency of the calls to be made to merge.dev
- We assume that the data that we fetch by querying merge.dev can fit into memory. Merge.dev provides pagination. We either assume that pagination is not required for our scenarios or we are going to build a native routine where it internally does all the paging required.


## Flow of the Document
The document uses discussion format to build the design in order to highlight the importance of each component instead of directly stating the final design. Also, it allows the implementation stages to be laid out easily.

## 2. UI
The UI and the backend would share a 'socket-based' connection. The system that will answer questions would be a system that will have latency closer to 10 seconds. In such scenario, it is essential that we keep user informed the actions being taken. It reduces the perception of the latency.

The UI would support the following functions:
```
on_chat_start(): 
   Sets up the environment and a greeting. Sets new_session_id, sets empty chat_history, sets up logging and latency tracking
```
```
on_message(message): 
   sends the message content, chat_history, session_id, a callback handler (used for streaming to the user action being taken) and calls the Query-Handler service, 
```
```
synthesize(response: Response): 
   renders the response object in a sequence of the ui_objects in the response by utilizing the element_type
```

``` 
class Response:
      List[ui_object] ui_objects
   
class ui_object:
   json: str
   element_type: element_type

class element_type(Enum):
    text,
    image,
    table
```

The UI also should include 'Feedback mechanism' and 'Debug mode', which will be discussed in the corresponding sections.

## 3. [Core Components](#high_level_design)
This section describes the design of the components that are absolutely essential for the core execution flow
## 3.1. [Orchestrator](#orchestrator)
The orchestrator is the top level 'agent' class that receives the user's question and plans the execution based on the chat_history, user_ask, tools and knowledge_graph. The orchestrator first fetches information relevant to the user's ask from chat_history and knowledge_graph. This information needs not be robust. It can be as simple as fetching previous couple of conversations.
The orchestrator relies on the Query Planner to plan out list of tasks to execute in order to answer user's question. The orchestrator then picks the independent tasks from that DAG and fetches responses for those tasks. The query plan is updated based on the responses obtained from those independent tasks.

The orchestrator also streams back to the UI, the curent independent tasks that are being executed to keep the user updated about the progress.

```
def orchestrator(chat_history: List[{"user/bot":"content"}], message: str, context: [KnowledgeGraph]):
   - Selects chat_history from a window
   - Pulls context related to user from Knowledge Graph
   - query_plan_dag = QueryPlanner(history, message, context_from_knowledge_graph, tools)
   - topological_sort(query_plan_dag)
   Recursively_execute_DAG_using_Query_planner():
      - select_independent_tasks_from_plan
      - for each of the independent tasks, async simultaneously call query_plan_executor
      - collect responses from independent tasks into 'observation'
      - get context from chat_history and knowledge_graph for next_task_in_dag
      - update_query_plan_DAG(response_from_dependency, next_task_in_dag, context_from_knowledge_graph)
      - Foreach independent_task, recursively_call_plan_executor
```
## 3.1.1. [Query Planner](#query_planner)

Query planner is the most critical step of the orchestrator. A good control over this execution is the key to hallucination-free question-answer system.
A query planner is a system that generates the plan of execution for the query, given the context (see Conversation history and Knowledge Graph) and the tools (see Scenario Agents).

*Note: In the demo implementation, I have relied on ZERO_SHOT_ReACT way for Query Planning for the sake of quick implementation for demo. However, it is very important that we have finer control over this stage and not be solely dependent on ZERO_SHOT_ReACT for this stage.*

```
class Query():
    """Class representing a single question in a query plan that can be executed by single tool."""

    id: int = Field(..., description="Unique id of the query")
    context: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Context to be provided to answer this question",
    )
    tool: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="The tool that is needed to answer this question",
    )
    question: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Question asked using a question answering system",
    )
    dependencies: List[int] = Field(
        default_factory=list,
        description="List of sub questions that need to be answered before asking this question",
    )


class QueryPlan():
    """Container class representing a tree of questions to ask a question answering system."""

    query_graph: List[Query] = Field(
        ..., description="The query graph representing the plan"
    )

    def _dependencies(self, ids: List[int]) -> List[Query]:
        """Returns the dependencies of a query given their ids."""
        return [q for q in self.query_graph if q.id in ids]
```

```
def query_planner(question: str, context: str, tools:[Tool]) -> QueryPlan:
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a world class query planning algorithm capable ofbreaking apart questions into its dependency queries such that the answers can be used to inform the parent question. Do not answer the questions, simply provide a correct compute graph with good specific questions to ask and relevant dependencies. Before you call the function, think step-by-step to get a better understanding of the problem.",
        }, # We need to further refine/experiment with this prompt and it can be a case for fine-tuning if needed. 
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Consider: {question}\nGenerate the correct query plan.",
        },
    ]

    return query_plan
```
A DAG of the Query plan would be of this form for the query, *Summarize my last conversation with Bill's company*
```
{
    "query_graph": [
        {
            "dependencies": [],
            "id": 1,
            "tool": "CRM",
            "question": "Get Bill from contacts",
            "context": ""
        },
        {
            "dependencies": [1],
            "id": 2,
            "tool": "CRM",
            "question": "Get {Bill.account_id}'s Company",
            "context": ""
        },
        {
            "dependencies": [2],
            "id": 3,
            "tool": "SINGLE",
            "question": "Find last conversation with {Bill's company}",
            "context": ""
        },
        {
            "dependencies": [3],
            "id": 4,
            "tool": "Synthesis",
            "question": "Summarize {last conversation with Bill's company}",
            "context": ""
        },
    ]
}
```


## 3.1.2. [Query Plan Executor](#plan_executor)
*Note: This is not precise proposed design. Using this image, I would like to highlight how we approach the loop of execution and a Graceful Exit in case we are not able to answer*
![Graceful Exit](./images/ToolsAndGracefulExit.png)

The Query plan Executor takes the Query Plan DAG as the input, does a topological sort to determine the the independent tasks that can be executed.

```
def execute_plan(query_graph:QueryPlan):
   independent_tasks = [task for task in query_graph if len(task.dependencies == 0]
   responses = [task.tool.execute(task.question, task.context) for task in independent_tasks]

# Each Tool class has an 'execute' function
def execute(question: str, context: str):
   tool.execute(question, context)
```

After execution of the independent tasks in the Query Plan, the Executor updates the context and also updates the Query Plan.

```
updated_context = update_context(context:str, responses:List[Response]):

def update_context(context:str, responses:List[Response]):
   for response in responses:
      context.append(responses) # It is mostly a simple append. We can alternatively set it as 'observation' 
```

```
def update_plan(question: str, plan_to_be_updated:QueryPlan, updated_context: str, tools:List[Tool]):
   updated_plan = query_planner(question, plan_to_be_updated, updated_context, tools)
```

The updated_plan is again executed with execute_plan. This is done recursively until no further tasks are remaining.

## 3.1.3 [Turn Memory](#turn_memory)

We define 'Turn' as one iteration of execution of independent tasks. Turn memory is the internal state of the current turn in a conversation. It can be either in-memory non-persistent storage. It contains information about retrievals, actions, and other data that has been processed so far in the current turn. Turn memory is updated after every 'turn' and is used to consolidate the chat memory, which is the consolidated internal memory of the bot over time. The Turn memory, in an iteration that includes Human response, is utilized to update the Personal Knowledge Graph (expanded below). Turn memory is used by the planning loop to make decisions about how to respond to the user's input. 

```
Class TurnMemory:
   def update_turn_memory(question, response, context, tool):
      pass

   # Turn memory can be quite big when response is big. This method is used to retrieve only relevant information from Turn memory
   def retrieve_relevant_information_from_turn_memory(question, ):
      pass
```

## 3.2. [Scenario Agents](#query_planner)
![Tool Setup](./images/ToolSetupGuidelines.png)

Tools are executables/plugins that take 'Natural Language Input' that an agent can use to accomplish a task. 

```
Class Tool(BaseTool):
   name="Tool Name"
   description="Description"
   system_message="" #Tool invocation guideline + Examples + Responding guidelines + Responding examples + self-identification instruction
```

Each of the HRIS (HR, Payroll and Directory), Recruiting (ATS), Accounting, Ticketing, CRM, Marketing Automation are built into an individual tool.
Each tool should be capable of taking the input in 'Natural Language' form. Each tool is an AI agent that can process a 'single question' (i.e. a Question that can be answered by a invocation of a single method)

```
class CRM(BaseTool):
   name=""
   description=""
   system_message=""

    def _run(self, utterance: str):
        - Use OpenAI function call for 'answering' 'single question' 
        - List of functions are all the functions that are supported by merge.dev sdk.
        - Add additional function for 'error scenario' if none of the functions are able to answer the question.
        return response


   # A sample function
   def search_contacts(name:str):
      """ Doc string describing the function and its input parameter requirements """
      call merge.dev CRM api to search by name.

```
*Note: In the demo implementation, I have used OpenAI agent with each function as a tool to this agent*

![Scenario Agents](./images/ScenarioAgents.png)

As highlighted in the system diagram above, each vertical is an individual agent that can answer a single question. 

*Discussion on Choices (Cost Optimization):* 
We do not need a complicated AI agent here. Many traditional NLP models like the ones used in Alexa, Cortana etc. can also do this functionality. The system requires a combination of 'Intent classifier' and 'Entity Extractor'. Intent classifier selects the most appropriate 'function' that can answer the  'Natural Language Question' and an Entity Extractor can extract the input parameters for that function.
This is extremely cheap, extremely low latency in comparison with the LLM based approach.

The above description of the role of a tool in answering a 'single' question fails in two cases:
- No appropriate function is detected
- Entity extraction from the question does not yield all the input parameters needed for invoking the relevant function.

## 3.3. [Human Input Tool]
In the case where Entity extraction from the question does not yield all the input parameters needed for invoking the relevant function, the ai agent is empowered with Human-Input-Tool where an appropriate question is placed to the user to help get the missing (or selecting) input parameter.

Every scenario agent has an access to Human Input tool. Both the question to the user and answer by the user to that question is to be added to the Chat History. The 'knowledge' from this interaction is also added to the Personal Knowledge Graph (to be discussed in more detail in the Knowledge graph section) 

```
class HumanInputTool(BaseTool):
   """Tool that asks user for input."""

   name: str = "Human"
   description: str = (
      "You can ask a human for disambiguation when you have to make a choice and you do not have enough information to make the choice."
      "The input should be a detailed question with entire observation for the human to answer."
   )
   prompt_func: Callable[[str], None] = Field(default_factory=lambda: _print_func)
   input_func: Callable = Field(default_factory=lambda: input)

   def _run(
      self,
      query: str,
      run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None,
   ) -> str:
      """Use the Human input tool."""
      # self.prompt_func(query)
      res = asyncio.run(cl.AskUserMessage(content=query).send())
      if res:
         return res['content']
      
   async def _arun(self, query: str,
      run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None,
      ) -> str:
      """Use the Human input tool."""
      # self.prompt_func(query)
      res = await cl.AskUserMessage(content=query).send()
      if res:
         return res['content']    
```



## 3.4. [Terminal State Reasoning Tool (Graceful exit)]
![Graceful Exit](./images/ToolsAndGracefulExit.png)

The query plan executor after executing the plan using an determines if it was able to answer the question or not.

```
def does_response_answer_user_task(response:str, question:str, context: str):
   facts_asked_in_question = Extract the fact(s) asked in the question.
   [facts_in_response] = Extract the fact(s) present in the response.

   foreach(var fact in facts_asked_in_question)

   if not(is_any_fact_in_response_answers(fact_in_question)):
      invoke graceful_exit(unaswered_facts_asked_in_question, facts_in_response)
```

```
def graceful_exit(unaswered_facts_asked_in_question, facts_in_response)
   cl.send_msg(print(f"I'm sorry, I do not have information to answer {fact_asked_in_the_question}"))
```

## 3.3. [Synthesis](#synthesis)

Synthesis agent is very crucial component for generating a chat-like-natural response from the facts in the response. It has the following goals:
- Generate a natural language fluent response from facts in response
- Invoke appropriate UI element for a better display of the response
- Provide references to the facts presented in the response to give confidence to the user about the response and for further reading by the user.

```
class SynthesisAgent():
    name = "SynthesisAgent"
    description = "The SynthesisAgent is to be used Always for generating the output to the user. \
        It will select the appropriate UI elements and language to be presented to the user."

    def __init__(self, config):
        self.responsible_ai_agent = ResponsibleAIAgent()
        self.config = config

        # Perform Responsible AI Checks
        if (self.responsible_ai_agent.shouldFlag(agent_response)):

## 3.4. [ResponsibleAI](#responsibleAI)

Responsible-AI in our design has four roles:
- *Flag Inappropriate Question:* If user question is inappropriate/violates policy, Flag the user question and provide graceful exit
- *Flag Inappropriaate Answer:* If the response content contains inappropriate content/violates policy, provide graceful exit and flag response for internal review of data present
- *Flag Prompt Injection Attempt*: Flag if user question asks to violate/ignore internal instructions
- *Flag Prompt Leakage*: From collection of all internal prompts, verify if any prompt is part of the response

*Discussion:*
For flagging inappropriate question/response, the solution needs to be a combination of 
- Moderation layer provided by OpenAI API
- Guardlist that reflects company's own policy and offensive terms.

## 3.5. [Hotfix](#hotfix)

LLM's are by design not always reliable. We need to plan for a hotfix architecture in case a high priority bug is reported. A hotfix architecture (or user-override/tenant-level override architecture) for every LLM action.

Hotfix service is a key value store (Object store) where key is the natural language sentence and the value is a json. For scenario agents, the JSON is a pair (function_name, [parameters]).

TODO: Image for hotfix
```
class HotfixElement:
   key:str
   value: HotfixValue

class HotfixValue:
   function_name: str
   parameters: List[str]

class LLM:
   def __init__(self):
   self.hotfix = hotfix_service(llm_key) #one hotfix key_value look-up per type of llm

## Chat History
Chat History is the user-visible messages and responses between user and agent.
Chat History is per session. A new session starts a new set for Chat history.

Storage: Chat History is to be stored in any object-store (ex: AWS S3). 
UI will provide access to list of sessions and user can continue their chat in that session from where it is left. The backend Orchestrator is provided access to all the Chat history in that session.
